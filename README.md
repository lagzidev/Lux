# LuxEngine
This engine is based on the [FNA framework](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA).

## TODO:
* Add a content management system to automatically change the content file's properties (e.g. Copy to output directory = Copy if newer)

## Useful Material
* [Game programming patterns book](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) - Really great book for game engine design.

* [FNA Tutorial series](https://gist.github.com/flibitijibibo/1ce4b7899b3cf1805a420330f0d2faf3#the-first-download) - A great comprehensive learning resource for new FNA users.

* [Useful MonoGame related links](http://community.monogame.net/t/useful-monogame-related-links-u-mg-rl/8573/22) - Less relevent for FNA but still worth keeping saving.

* [Introduction to MonoGame](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/graphics-games/monogame/introduction/) - by Microsoft.

## Useful Libraries

* [Tools used for Celeste](https://celestegame.tumblr.com/tools) - This includes Crunch for spritesheets and BMFont for packing fonts.

* [FNA-Template](https://github.com/AndrewRussellNet/FNA-Template) - A simple template for FNA game projects. This was useful only as a reference for creating this project from scratch. This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNw-9S_GdW8) explains how to use this project.

* [awesome-monogame](https://github.com/aloisdeniel/awesome-monogame) - A hand-picked bookmark collection of libraries for building games with Monogame (many work with FNA as well).

* [Monocle Engine](https://bitbucket.org/MattThorson/monocle-engine/src/default/) - by Matt Thorson, creator of Celeste and Towerfall.

* [NEZ](https://github.com/prime31/Nez) - a free 2D focused framework that works with MonoGame and FNA.

* [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/tlgkccampbell/ultraviolet) - an XNA alternative
## Troubleshooting
### (Linux/macOS) Setting the library path for debugging

In order to run in the debugger on Visual Studio for Mac or MonoDevelop, you will need to add an environment variable:

- Right click the FNATemplate project
- Options
- Run -> Configurations -> Default
- Environment Variables -> Add

On **macOS**, set the following environment variable:

- Variable = `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, Value = `./osx/`

On **Linux**, set one of the following:

- 64-bit: Variable = `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, Value = `./lib64`
- 32-bit: Variable = `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, Value = `./lib`

You will need to repeat these steps for any new projects you create from the template (because they are per-user debugging settings, not part of the project file).

If the template crashes inside FNA with a DllNotFoundException, possibly as the inner exception of a TypeInitializationException, you forgot this step!
